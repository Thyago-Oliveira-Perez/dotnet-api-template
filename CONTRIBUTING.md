## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

If you encounter a bug:

* Search existing issues to avoid duplicates
* Open a new issue with:

  * A clear and descriptive title
  * Steps to reproduce the issue
  * Expected vs. actual behavior
  * Relevant logs, screenshots, or stack traces (if applicable)

Clear bug reports help issues get resolved faster.

---

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are welcome.

When proposing an improvement:

* Explain the problem you’re trying to solve
* Describe the proposed solution
* Mention alternatives you’ve considered (if any)

This helps align expectations before implementation begins.

---

### Submitting Pull Requests

Before opening a pull request:

* Fork the repository
* Create a feature branch from the default branch (`main` or `master`)
* Ensure your changes are focused and scoped
* Add or update tests when applicable
* Update documentation if behavior or APIs change

Pull requests should:

* Have a clear description of *what* was changed and *why*
* Reference related issues when applicable
* Be small and reviewable whenever possible

---

## Development Guidelines

General guidelines:

* Keep code readable and maintainable
* Favor clarity over cleverness
* Follow existing project structure and conventions
* Avoid introducing unnecessary abstractions
* Write tests for new logic when appropriate

Consistency matters more than personal preference.

---

## Commit Messages

Use clear and meaningful commit messages.

Recommended format:

* Short summary in the first line (imperative mood)
* Optional detailed description in the body

Examples:

* `Fix incorrect date parsing in report generation`
* `Add validation for empty input values`

---

## Pull Request Review Process

All pull requests are reviewed before being merged.

During review:

* Feedback may include requested changes or clarifications
* Discussions should remain constructive and technical
* Be open to suggestions — the goal is code quality and long‑term maintainability

Once approved, the pull request will be merged by a maintainer.
